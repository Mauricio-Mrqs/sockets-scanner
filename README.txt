This is a simple port scan with sockets library.
I did it to sort of taking the first step in learning cybersecurity and i thought that it would be good to align cybersecurity with python, and i did this.
Of course is not a ultra-complex-master-project, but i did as a first step to study this subjects, now i'm studying networks.

In this i imported the sockets library to scan the ports and to make it faster i imported the librarys: queue and threading.
The queue makes possible to iterate all the elements and the threads does it in a parallel way.

I'm a beginner in the area so i saw a video to make a base, the video i took as inspiration is the video from FreeCodeCamp.
